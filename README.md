# Online-Retail-Customer-Segmentation
 In this era of a highly competitive business environment, a company must make effective marketing policies. A company might have several groups of customers. When a company is small, these customer groups are easily identifiable, and each customer is easily targetable. As the company grows, it becomes difficult to analyze customer behavior, and companies cannot give individual attention to different customer requirements. For a medium or large company, the focus is not only acquiring new customers but also retaining existing customers. Many companies survive only by certain groups of customers loyal to the company. These customers generate high revenues, make promotions, and help the company to set up newer benchmarks. When the resources are limited, a company cannot invest too much in customers and it becomes crucial to identify those loyal customers. Moreover, companies must focus on preventing customer churn by resolving the issue of these dissatisfied customers. Hence, companies perform customer segmentation.

We have loaded the data, treated the NULL values, performed feature engineering, performed exploratory data analysis, and built ML models. After segregating the customers into different categories, we analyzed the behavior of customers in each category and concluded the following conclusions.

•	The United Kingdom is the country with the highest number of customers.

•	Most sales occur in the ending months of the year.

•	Saturday is the weekly off, and the company is closed from 8 PM to 6 AM.

•	The Netherlands is the country that generates the highest revenue.

•	There are 3 clusters of customers.

•	In cluster 0, we have some customers who spent heavily but not recently. We need to identify them and initiate a reactivation campaign. We can also offer them promotions and conduct surveys to know what went wrong. In this way, we can avoid losing them to competitors.

•	For cluster 1 customers, we can offer membership or loyalty programs. We can recommend them related products to upsell them. This initiative helps to make them loyal customers of the company. 

•	We can reward Cluster 2 customers. They can adapt to new products. Moreover, they help to promote the company.
